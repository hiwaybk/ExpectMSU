ExpectMSU is a Perl module for use internally at Montclair State
University.  It requires the use of Expect.pm to connect to MSU VAX/VMS
systems and MSU Cisco routers.

If you do not have Expect installed, you can use the following command
to download and install it:
	perl -MCPAN -e'install Bundle::Expect'

Installation on a system with a properly configured Perl package should be as
easy as entering "make all" from the top level directory of the distribution.

If you have problems or would like to try the Perl standard method of
installation, cd to the Source directory and follow the same steps as for
the installtion of most other Perl modules:
        1) Use Perl to create the Makefile:
                perl Makefile.pl
        2) Prepare the module:
                make
        3) Install the module:
                make install
        4) Go have a beer.  :)
